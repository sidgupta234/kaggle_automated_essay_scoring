### About the project

Writing is a foundational skill. Sadly, it's one few students are able to hone, often because writing tasks are infrequently assigned in school. A rapidly growing student population, students learning English as a second language, known as English Language Learners (ELLs), are especially affected by the lack of practice. While automated feedback tools make it easier for teachers to assign more writing tasks, they are not designed with ELLs in mind.

This project is aimed to build a submission for the Kaggle contest (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-english-language-learning)

Essays on this website will be rated from a scale of 1-5 on the basis of Vocabulary and Conventions.
